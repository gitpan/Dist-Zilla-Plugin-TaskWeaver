#pod =head1 DESCRIPTION
#pod
#pod The TaskWeaver plugin acts just like the PodWeaver plugin, but gets its claws
#pod just a bit into your Pod::Weaver configuration and then uses them to figure out
#pod prerequisites and grouping for building a Task distribution.
#pod
#pod The C<Task::> namespace is used for libraries that do not have any code of
#pod their own, but are just ways of getting a lot of other libraries installed at
#pod once.  In other words, they're just prerequisites with no actual logic.
#pod
#pod TaskWeaver expects that your F<.pm> file will have Pod like the following:
#pod
#pod   =pkgroup Modules That are Useful
#pod
#pod   =pkg Sub::Exporter 0.901 first version with teeth
#pod
#pod   =pkg Sub::Import
#pod
#pod   =pkgroup Modules That are Useless
#pod
#pod   =pkg Acme::ProgressBar 1.10
#pod
#pod The C<=pkgroup> directives start groups of prerequisites.  You must have at
#pod least one C<=pkgroup> (although that may change).  The C<=pkg> directives list
#pod specific directives, and are in the following format:
#pod
#pod   =pkg Package::Name  min_version  reason
#pod
#pod Both C<min_version> and C<reason> are optional, although you can't give a
#pod reason without giving a version.  If a reason is given, it will be included in
#pod the Pod to explain why the specific version is required.
#pod
#pod =head1 WARNING
#pod
#pod TaskWeaver works, but relies on doing some pretty evil stuff.  It may
#pod substantially change its method of operation in the future, but its
#pod expectations from your Pod should not change.
#pod
#pod =head1 ...AND ANOTHER THINGS
#pod
#pod If you use three part versions, like C<1.2.3>, you will want to require a very
#pod modern ExtUtils::MakeMaker, probably v6.68 or later.  You can do that with:
#pod
#pod   [Prereqs / EUMM]
#pod   -phase = configure
#pod   -type  = requires
#pod   ExtUtils::MakeMaker = 6.68
#pod
#pod =head2 Placeholder Testfile
#pod
#pod Due to the way various CPAN clients install modules, it is necessary
#pod to generate a fake testfile so there is at least a test in the distribution.
#pod
#pod If you do not want to generate the file, disable the C<placeholder_test>
#pod attribute.

=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::TaskWeaver - a PodWeaver plugin used to build Task distributions

=head1 VERSION

version 0.101627

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The TaskWeaver plugin acts just like the PodWeaver plugin, but gets its claws
just a bit into your Pod::Weaver configuration and then uses them to figure out
prerequisites and grouping for building a Task distribution.

The C<Task::> namespace is used for libraries that do not have any code of
their own, but are just ways of getting a lot of other libraries installed at
once.  In other words, they're just prerequisites with no actual logic.

TaskWeaver expects that your F<.pm> file will have Pod like the following:

  =pkgroup Modules That are Useful

  =pkg Sub::Exporter 0.901 first version with teeth

  =pkg Sub::Import

  =pkgroup Modules That are Useless

  =pkg Acme::ProgressBar 1.10

The C<=pkgroup> directives start groups of prerequisites.  You must have at
least one C<=pkgroup> (although that may change).  The C<=pkg> directives list
specific directives, and are in the following format:

  =pkg Package::Name  min_version  reason

Both C<min_version> and C<reason> are optional, although you can't give a
reason without giving a version.  If a reason is given, it will be included in
the Pod to explain why the specific version is required.

=head1 WARNING

TaskWeaver works, but relies on doing some pretty evil stuff.  It may
substantially change its method of operation in the future, but its
expectations from your Pod should not change.

=head1 ...AND ANOTHER THINGS

If you use three part versions, like C<1.2.3>, you will want to require a very
modern ExtUtils::MakeMaker, probably v6.68 or later.  You can do that with:

  [Prereqs / EUMM]
  -phase = configure
  -type  = requires
  ExtUtils::MakeMaker = 6.68

=head2 Placeholder Testfile

Due to the way various CPAN clients install modules, it is necessary
to generate a fake testfile so there is at least a test in the distribution.

If you do not want to generate the file, disable the C<placeholder_test>
attribute.
